# Wickwarden — orchestrator handoff

Audience: a new orchestrator (an agent session or a human) who takes over the build with no other context.
Language: English. The owner writes Swedish; see section 7 for how to talk to him.

Read this file first, then [state.md](state.md). The rules for agents are in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Status (update at every push)

Updated 2026-10-25 20:58 UTC. Final gated runtime `fd5e59725ff1114881c4d5d567aaf56f8c9017e2` was published in docs-bearing commit `fd7982d3fade5f63b270ea103c2375ff892db1e3`. The first checkpoint push advanced personal `origin/main` from `1eebc1eaf59a64ec95c9e904b3257f01e8f46458`; `ls-remote` returned exact `fd7982d3fade5f63b270ea103c2375ff892db1e3` at 20:58:06 UTC under account `mikaelliljedahl`. Personal remote: https://github.com/mikaelliljedahl/wickwarden.git. This final status follow-up changes only these two docs and preserves the tested runtime tree.

**Final gate evidence:** isolated logs are in `/tmp/wickwarden-finalpause-fd5e597-logs/`. `make check` passed 133/133 Godot suites, lint and world-data checks; Python generator/compiler tests passed 172. `rooms-check` passed 221/221, `art-test` 22/22, and global ownership passed for 92 WPs and 53 batches (192 rooms, 33 pockets). The first import and all graphics used Dummy audio. The verifier reported no timeout, SIGSEGV, engine/script/parse error, leak, skip or waiver. The detached test worktree was removed. These results apply to `fd5e597` only.

**Included changes:** P09's permanent low fence lets the real Tether Moth fetch through while blocking the player; cloned room placement and missing-art fallback passed in the actual World. The checkpoint also includes C09 props/fragment/portal/hidden reveal fixes, pocket-exit framing, sling-ammo HUD art, Cinder Wick light, Lock Warden plates, B06/B09 and heavy-door presentation, actor-only Abacus Brute and Pale Squire cues, and M5 Mirror Shade alpha presentation with default production GPU proof. Cue timings, radii and damage are unchanged. The all-ten guide landed in `d83944f`; correction `bb0821b` passed independent review at `/tmp/walkthrough-review.md`. It is a recommended guide, not Q3's recorded playthrough. Archivist fix `6753dcf` and multiple global cohorts clear the earlier SIGSEGV concern.

**Remaining work:** B09 body/keyhole, Gloam Knight, Coinwyrm, Ninth Lantern and B01 mouth art are open or on HOLD. Broader cue polish remains for Lull Mauler, Hushed Colossus, Dirge Choir, Wick Automaton, Corrow's Echo, Hollow Captain, Mirror Warden, Thorn Warden, The Unlit and shared markers. Human balance, Q3 continuous playthrough, Q5 per-room review, Q6 economy/soak, Q7 full weakness matrix, Q8 performance and release remain open. C1 uses its small key and C5's door is already open in the actual read-only save; the user's copy was untouched and no lock fix is claimed.

**Preserved worktree:** the 77 foreign staged paths retain fingerprint `cc7b8baf06d7e79c8d9ed63e5c68b4e971422c0795514e2e8381c9c1771cf4a3`. Two unstaged tracked paths remain outside this task: `docs/art-provenance.md` has 36 FX rows removed; producer-E `tools/art_prompts/PROGRESS_e.md` updates B43–45 and leaves B46–47 not started. Preserve these, plus all staged, untracked art candidate, import and UID work. User game audio remains on; agent tests remain on Dummy audio.

## 1. What the project is

- **Wickwarden** is a top-down action-adventure in **Godot 4.7** (GDScript).
- It is a mechanics-only homage to *Zelda 1* and *A Link to the Past*. Story, names and art are original. Do not copy another game's characters, names or art.
- Player: **Tamsin**. Tools: lamp hook, charge flare, ward, sub-items. Enemies: the **Hush**.
- Art is **hi-fi painterly GPT Image** (generated through Codex). Never an 8-bit or 16-bit look. No pixel art, no outlines on every shape, no text in images.
- **Step 1** (dev world, 7 rooms) and **step 2** (art pass) are done.
- **The world build** (192 rooms including caves, 33 pockets, 10 caves, 10 bosses, 5 miniboss pairs, 8 tools) has all 222 graph scene targets committed. Regional acceptance, QA, runtime art and release work remain in progress by work package (WP).
- **Repo:** `/home/mikael/code/github/wickwarden`. Remote `origin` is `https://github.com/mikaelliljedahl/wickwarden.git`.
- **Account:** the repo is **private** on the **personal** account `mikaelliljedahl`, not the Auxality account. Do not use the Auxality account for this repo.
- **Pushes** require explicit integration assignment under the owner's standing authorization (see section 7). Use the installed `gh` binary as a command-local Git credential helper for the personal account. Do not persist credential configuration or print/store tokens; never use the Auxality account.

- **No AI attribution** in commits, PRs, code or docs. No `Co-authored-by` lines, no "generated with" lines.

## 2. Reading order

Index: [README.md](README.md). Where two documents differ, a binding document wins, and `decisions.md` wins over every plan.

Read in this order:

1. [state.md](state.md): where the project stands (may be stale; check section "Status" of this file and `git log`).
2. [decisions.md](decisions.md) (**binding**): the owner's decisions of 2026-10-24, numbered 1–44.
3. [world-work-packages.md](world-work-packages.md) (**binding**): sections 3 (rules for every WP), 4 (interface contracts), 5 (wave 0), then the table of the wave you work on. Section 12 has the dependency graph, section 13 the rules for agents.
4. [code-contract.md](code-contract.md) (**binding**): section 1 (rules), section 16 (world build contract: 16.1 scope, 16.2 rules for every world WP, 16.3 interfaces, 16.4 flags, 16.8 file layout).
5. [world-plan.md](world-plan.md) (**binding**): the master plan (rooms, gates, caves, tools). Reference, large (117 KB). Read the section your WP names.
6. [world-graph.json](world-graph.json) (**binding** data): the graph. `data/world_data.json` is generated from it. Never edit the JSON by hand.
7. [monsters-bosses-tools.md](monsters-bosses-tools.md) (**binding**): monsters, minibosses, bosses, tools. Section 7 lists API additions.
8. [asset-contract.md](asset-contract.md) (**binding**): art interface (cells, foot line, strips, manifest, `SpriteVisual`).
9. Guides: [art-brief.md](art-brief.md), [art-inventory.md](art-inventory.md), [art-provenance.md](art-provenance.md), [room-kit.md](room-kit.md) (F6, committed in `e433d40`), [intro-script.md](intro-script.md), [story.md](story.md) (context), [audio-provenance.md](audio-provenance.md).
10. History: [dev-world-plan.md](dev-world-plan.md) (step 1), `screens/`.

Commands (from `Makefile`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make run` | start the game |
| `make dev` | start with all items, 10 pots, 5 keys, F1 hitbox overlay |
| `make import` | rebuild class cache (needed after adding or renaming a `class_name`) |
| `make test` | every `tests/test_*.gd`, each in its own headless Godot process. Subset: `make test T="player enemy"` |
| `make lint` | `gdlint scripts tests` (gdtoolkit 4.5.0 via uv) |
| `make format` | `gdformat` (not in `check`) |
| `make check` | import + test + lint + world-check + world-gen-test. **The gate.** |
| `make world-data` | regenerate `data/world_data.json` |
| `make world-check` | fail if the committed data differs from the graph |
| `make world-gen-test` | unit tests of the generator |

| `make audio` | synthesise sounds (`tools/make_audio.py`) |
| `make rooms`, `make rooms-check` | Wired to `tools/build_rooms.py`; compile only explicitly owned room ids during concurrent work. |
| `make capture-all` | Full 222-target still-capture baseline is committed at `d3cf9a5` in 16 area sheets; human visual review remains pending. |
| `make playthrough` | Full earned-route shards and acceptance remain pending (Q3). |

Other checkers (not in `make check`):
- `python3 tools/check_ownership.py --global`
- `python3 tools/check_world_graph.py --stats --rounds --orders`
- `python3 -m unittest tools/test_check_ownership.py`

## 3. The orchestration workflow

The lead (you) delegates and does as little as possible. Each WP is done by one agent. The lead delegates verification to an integration worker.

**Model rule (owner update, 2026-10-25):** use Codex **Luna xhigh** for mechanical tasks to save budget. The root lead orchestrates; workers execute implementation and checks. Model labels in the binding WP plan remain historical assignments; do not edit normative documents to match this workflow instruction.

**Per-WP flow:**

1. Pick a WP whose `Depends` are merged (committed on `main`) and whose files do not overlap with running WPs.
2. Start one agent with the brief of section 4.
3. The agent works in small steps. After each step it runs `make test T="<own suites>"`.
4. The agent commits only its own paths (`git add <paths>`, never `git add -A`). It reports.
5. The integration worker verifies on the lead’s instruction:
   - `git log --oneline | head` shows the commit, and `git show --stat <hash>` shows only the WP's Owns files.
   - `python3 tools/check_ownership.py <WP>` with the file list on stdin (see below) prints OK.
   - `make check` is green on the new HEAD.
   - The report lists the screenshot check where the WP needs one (`tools/capture.tscn`).
6. If a check fails, the lead sends the agent back, or starts a fix WP with its own Owns list. The lead does not hand-edit agent files without a reason.
7. Update `docs/state.md` when a WP lands (AGENTS rule). Update the status section of this file at every push.

**Ownership check.** The checker reads the changed file list on stdin:

```
(git diff --name-only; git ls-files --others --exclude-standard) | python3 tools/check_ownership.py P01
```

Output: `OK P01: n file(s) inside Owns` or `STRAY <path>` with exit 1. Other modes: `--base REF` (takes changed files from `git diff` against REF; note that it includes other agents' work, so use the stdin form for a single WP), `--global` (whole manifest: no path owned twice in waves 1–5), `--regen` (rebuild room-batch entries from the tables; needed only when the graph changes). The manifest is `tools/wp_ownership.json`.

**Parallel rules.**
- Run in parallel only WPs with disjoint files whose `Depends` are done.
- Waves 1–5: no two WPs own the same file (`--global` checks this).
- Wave 0 is sequential (F7 to F14 touch `world.gd`, `player.gd`, `hud.gd`, `pause_menu.gd`).
- `project.godot` and `Makefile` are shared: serialise the WPs that touch them.

**Git rules for agents and lead.**
- Commit only your own paths: `git add <paths>`. Never `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- Never `git reset`, `git stash`, `git checkout -- <file>`, `git clean` or force-push. Other agents' uncommitted work is in the tree.
- If `git status` shows staged files that are not yours, commit with the paths: `git commit -m "<msg>" -- <your paths>`. Do not unstage others' files.
- Do not push unless explicitly assigned integration push work by the lead (section 7).
- Commit messages: short, imperative, no WP-internal jargon needed. No AI attribution.

**Code rules (from `world-work-packages.md` section 3 and `code-contract.md` 16.2; AGENTS.md is the short form).**
- Read first: AGENTS.md, the contract section, the WP row, the named inputs. Never guess dimensions, paths or interfaces.
- Only write files in your `Owns` list. Anything else is reported, not patched.
- Movement and combat logic in `_physics_process`.
- Damage in half-hearts (int).
- `Layers.*` constants for collision layers, never numbers.
- `load()` with a null check for files another WP delivers. Never `preload()` for those.
- **No `class_name` in new WP files.** Older files keep theirs: `World`, `Placeholder`, `WorldData`, `Hud`, `ItemRegistry`, `PauseMenu`. (`extends "res://path.gd"` is fine.)
- Every entity has a `Visual` child. Game logic never reads from `Visual`.
- Placeholder art only for new entities (`Placeholder.register_kind(...)`). Art comes later.
- Persistence by `GameState` flags (names in code contract 16.4), never by room node state.
- No tutorial text or pop-up instructions in the game world. Button help only in the pause menu. Story text (title, intro, ending) is allowed.
- Tests: `tests/test_*.gd` are auto-discovered by `make test`. Each test file needs its suite to pass alone.
- Verify visually as well as with tests: `tools/capture.tscn` saves a 1920x1080 screenshot.
- A WP that finds a spec problem stops and reports it. It does not change numbers or normative documents.

## 4. How to start agents

Use AgentTeamForge with the Codex backend and the repo working directory. For mechanical tasks, use **Luna xhigh** per the owner. Read the current ATF tool schema for exact model identifiers and fields. Parallel jobs need disjoint owned paths. The root lead coordinates; delegated workers run shell commands and make changes.

Agents need self-contained briefs, including the current shared-tree and push restrictions.

**Brief template (fill the `<...>` parts):**

```
You are building work package <WP id> of Wickwarden (Godot 4.7, GDScript) in <repo path>.
You are one of several agents in this repo at the same time. Other agents have uncommitted files. Not yours: leave them.

READ FIRST (in this order, skip nothing):
1. AGENTS.md (repo root).
2. docs/world-work-packages.md: section 3 (rules), section 4 (interface contracts), the row of <WP id>, and the rows of its Depends: <Depends list>.
3. docs/code-contract.md: section 1 and section 16 (16.2 rules, 16.3 interfaces, 16.4 flags, 16.8 file layout).
4. docs/decisions.md (binding).
5. <WP-specific inputs: e.g. docs/monsters-bosses-tools.md section X, docs/world-plan.md section Y>.

YOUR FILES: only the paths in your Owns list: <Owns from the WP row and tools/wp_ownership.json>. Write nothing else. If you need a change elsewhere, stop and report it.

RULES: no class_name in new files; load() with null check for files from other WPs; Layers.* for collision; damage in half-hearts (int); every entity has a Visual child; movement in _physics_process; placeholder art only; no tutorial text in the world; no AI attribution anywhere.

GIT: never git add -A, never reset, stash, checkout or clean. Commit only your paths: git add <your paths>, then git commit -m "<message>" -- <your paths>. Do not push. Other agents commit at the same time; if git reports a conflict, stop and report.

WORK IN SMALL STEPS: one behaviour at a time. After each step run: make test T="<your suites>". Fix until green.

CHECK BEFORE YOU COMMIT:
- make test T="<your suites>" passes.
- make lint is clean.
- Ownership: (git diff --name-only; git ls-files --others --exclude-standard) | python3 tools/check_ownership.py <WP id>   must print OK.
- Visual check if the WP row names one: tools/capture.tscn, then look at the image.

FINAL COMMIT MESSAGE: "<short imperative summary>" (no WP jargon needed, no AI attribution).

REPORT (your final message, max 15 lines):
- DONE or FAILED.
- Commit hash.
- Every file touched.
- The exact result lines of make test and make lint.
- Unclear points or spec problems, one line each.
```

**Notes on the brief:**
- Give the WP its exact `Owns` line. Do not give a longer file list than the plan.
- Name the suites: `make test T="world"` works on a subset. Test file names map to `tests/test_<name>.gd`.
- If a worker fails twice on the same step, read its report and split the task into smaller assignments with explicit owned paths.

## 5. Art pipeline

**Documents and folders:**

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Inventory: 397 rows, 1461 images, 86 batches (section 4 is the batch table B01–B86) | `docs/art-inventory.md` |
| Style, shared prompt blocks, character designs | `docs/art-brief.md` |
| Interface (cells, foot line, strips, manifest, edge strip format) | `docs/asset-contract.md` (binding) |
| Prompt files, one per batch (`batch_NN.md`), each prompt with a job id heading | `tools/art_prompts/` |
| Rules for the prompts and the run recipe | `tools/art_prompts/README.md` |
| Output images | `tools/source_art/` (file names `<sheet>[_<facing>]_vN.png`, N = 1 to 3) |
| Per-batch log (file, session, output id, SHA-256, defects, exact prompt) | `tools/source_art/log_bNN.md` (also `log_terrain.md` etc.) |
| Source provenance table | `docs/art-provenance.md` (every kept image gets a row) |
| Progress | `tools/art_prompts/PROGRESS.md` (producers 1–3) and `PROGRESS_a.md` … `PROGRESS_h.md` (producers a–h, ranges below) |
| Invented design details per producer | `tools/art_prompts/DESIGNS_a.md` … `DESIGNS_h.md` |
| Manifest for `make art` | `tools/art_manifest.json` (only accepted sheets go in) |

**Producers (by batch range):** a 4–11, b 12–19, c 20–27, d 28–35, e 36–47, f 48–59, g 60–71, h 72–86. Each producer works only in its range.

**Recipe (Codex image jobs):**
1. Submit one AgentTeamForge job per image: `backend: "codex"`, `model: "cheapest"` (gpt-6-luna; the image tool is the same at every tier). One image per job.
2. Job text: "Make ONE image call with your native image generation tool. Pass the fenced prompt from the batch file EXACTLY as written, with the reference images listed in the entry attached. Copy the generated PNG only from `~/.codex/generated_images/<your session id>/`. Edit no other file. Run no git. Report output path, size, generated file name, session id, visible defects." Set `expected_outputs` to the absolute PNG path, `timeout_s` 900, a unique `idempotency_key` (the job id; resubmit under a new key, e.g. `<job id>-r1`).
3. Limit: at most **6 Codex jobs per producer** at a time, about 48 in total over 8 producers.
4. Wait with background sleeps (a foreground `sleep` is blocked). A job takes about 3–5 minutes.
5. **Verify every PNG:**
   - Get the job's `session_id` (`get_job` / `list_jobs`).
   - Take the PNG **only** from `~/.codex/generated_images/<session_id>/`. Never take the newest file in the folder: parallel jobs write there and sometimes copy another job's image. Several job reports named another session's file.
   - Compare its SHA-256 with the file in `tools/source_art/` and with all other files there. No duplicates allowed.
   - Look at each image (montage of three variants: `magick a.png b.png c.png -resize 1000x -append out.jpg`).
6. `stop_agent` every job after its wave (`list_jobs` shows `agent_live: true` for open ones). Image jobs cost no Codex weekly quota.
7. Write the log, add provenance rows, commit only `tools/source_art/`, `tools/art_prompts/` and `docs/art-provenance.md`.
8. Do not reject an image by hand without the owner. Weak images are logged; the owner culls. Regenerate at most three times for a sheet that breaks the rules in `tools/art_prompts/README.md` section "Run recipe" item 7.

**Prompt rules (from the README):** forbid pixel art, text, grids and frames, poses that touch, and other games' names. Keep the shared block verbatim. Demand one row of poses, flat key background (magenta or green, never in the subject), `Image size: WxH.` as the last line. Walk cycles say in words which leg leads in which pose.

**Known art weak points (do not repeat them without a fix):**
- **Down and up views** often come out as **side profile** (batches 1–3 `pull_down`, `push_down`; batch 14 up units; batch 15 brine crab front and rear). Fix in later prompts: "her chest and face point at the viewer; her body is square to the camera, not turned to the right" (down); "her back is to the viewer, the braid and coat back visible" (up).
- **Walk cycles repeat poses**: poses 1 and 3 and poses 2 and 4 show the same leg arrangement. Fix: give every pose its own description (pose 1 = contact, leg A forward; pose 2 = passing; pose 3 = contact, leg B forward; pose 4 = passing with the other leg lifted).
- **Build agents cull variants**: the build agents pick one of v1–v3 per row when they use the images. The owner culls too. Do not assume a variant is accepted.
- Textures come back 1254x1254, not 1024x1024. Sheets may come back 2172x724 or 1536x1024. Do not resize by hand; log it.
- **Edge strips** (`edge_*`, decision 34: 384x96 cells, alpha, no foot line): the tool returns about 2.5:1 for a requested 4:1. **The cut tool has no edge-strip kind yet** (`tools/cut_sprites.py` has none). Edges are not cut until that task is done.
- Eight-frame strips (`fx_boss_death_light`, `fx_boss_death_wax`, `fx_rekindle_burst`) and `fx_chime_ring` (512 px cell, 480 px radius) have open cell-size questions (`DESIGNS_e.md`).
- Boardwalk tiles stand on legs or posts: prompt needs "flat on the ground, no legs, no stubs, no posts, nothing under the planks".
- Tallow flask drifts to a heart-shaped vessel (`tallow_flask`, batch 22, all failed); `jar_lit` similar.
- Glint poses come out with weak highlights.
- Batch 24: slag chunk orange glow; thorn hedge magenta spill.

**Art not yet in the game:** batches 1–3 and later art are not in `tools/art_manifest.json` until the owner accepts them. `make art` cuts only what the manifest lists.

## 6. Current working tree (other agents)

The tested code snapshot is `fd5e59725ff1114881c4d5d567aaf56f8c9017e2`; no code/art changes follow it. The first checkpoint push published the tested runtime and status docs. The shared index has 77 foreign staged paths (fingerprint recorded above), plus foreign unstaged and untracked work. The two unstaged tracked paths are `docs/art-provenance.md` (36 FX rows removed) and `tools/art_prompts/PROGRESS_e.md` (producer-E batches 43–45 updated; 46–47 not started). Preserve them and all art, import and UID files. The all-ten guide and README link are in `d83944f`, with correction `bb0821b` independently reviewed; leave both files untouched. This status follow-up commits only `docs/state.md` and `docs/handoff.md` with explicit paths; no broad staging, reset, stash, clean, amend or history rewrite.

## 7. Owner preferences (for the orchestrating lead)

- The owner writes **Swedish**. Replies to him are in **Swedish**, short plain sentences, in the style of **ASD-STE100** (one idea per sentence, simple words, no idioms).
- All **repo documents, code, comments, commit messages and PR texts are in English.**
- The owner wants the lead to **delegate**. The lead does little work itself. Start agents; verify; report.
- Do not ask needless questions. Decide small things yourself, note the choice in the status or in the doc, and go on. Ask only for decisions that the decisions document does not settle, or for pushes and irreversible actions the owner has not asked for.
- **Push policy:** push only when asked, or when the owner says to push continuously. **Currently: push continuously.** After every push, update the "Status (update at every push)" section of this file (date and HEAD) and commit that change too.
- Push command: `GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --user mikaelliljedahl) git push origin main`. Only the delegated integration worker pushes when instructed by the lead.
- No AI attribution in commits, PRs or docs.

## 8. Start here (checklist for the new orchestrator)

1. **Orient.** Read this file, then [state.md](state.md). Delegate shell inspection: `git log --oneline | head -20`, `git status` and `git diff --cached --stat`. Note HEAD. Update the status section here if it is out of date.
2. **Read the binding rules.** `decisions.md`, `code-contract.md` section 1 and section 16, `world-work-packages.md` sections 3, 4, 5 and 13. Skim `world-plan.md` and `monsters-bosses-tools.md` only where a WP names them.
3. **Delegate the gate check.** Have the integration worker run `make check` and `python3 tools/check_ownership.py --global`. Both must be green. If not, the first WP is a fix, not new content.
4. **Continue from the checkpoint.** Read current work and remaining batches above. Foundation and wave 1 are delivered; choose remaining wave 2 work with satisfied dependencies and disjoint ownership. Source production is closed; runtime art integration continues separately.
5. **Start ATF workers.** Use Codex Luna xhigh for mechanical work, with the brief of section 4. Parallel only with disjoint files. The root lead only orchestrates; delegate shell checks and document work too.
6. **Delegate verification of each result.** `git show --stat <hash>`, `python3 tools/check_ownership.py <WP>` with the stdin list, `make check` on HEAD. Fix or send back. Update `docs/state.md` when a WP lands.
7. **Art, when the wave needs it.** Pick the next batch from `docs/art-inventory.md` section 4 whose prompts exist (or write them with the README rules). Run the Codex recipe (section 5). Verify SHA-256, log, provenance, commit only art paths. Stop all jobs after the wave.
8. **Push and update.** The integration worker waits for the lead’s instruction while this shared tree is active. Under the continuous push authorization: `make check` green, push with the command of section 7, update the status section of this file with the date and new HEAD, commit that, and report to the owner in Swedish, short.

- Batch ids for rooms: `ow_<x>_<y>` overworld, `cave_<n>_<k>` caves, `#pocket` suffix for pockets.

## Open art points from producers (added by the previous lead)

- **Edge strips:** the image tool returns about 2.5:1 (for example 1983x793 or 2048x768) where docs/asset-contract.md asks for 4:1 (1536x384). The cut tool needs a rule for this before `edge_*` files can be cut: either crop and scale to the contract size, or order again. `edge_cave_floor_to_wall_v2` and `edge_cave_water_v2` failed (band too low, magenta above).
- **Sizes:** every 1024x1024 request returned 1254x1254. The cut tool must scale with one factor. Sheets of 1536x1024 return as requested.
- **Weak groups that need new prompts** (details in tools/art_prompts/PROGRESS_*.md and tools/source_art/log_bNN.md): brine crab front and rear views (side profile), choirling (too mossy; try `hush_skitterwick.png` as reference), mirror shade (coloured Tamsin instead of silhouette), many walk cycles that repeat poses 1=3 and 2=4, `wax_seal` (drips read as blood), `dry_vine_screen` and `bush_cluster` (cut would count wrong blobs), `pocket_plain_door` (too ornate), `pocket_lighthouse_door` (square base).
- **Producers:** Claude-side producers a-h ran on the previous lead's account. b (12-19) and d (28-35) finished. Check PROGRESS_a, _c, _e, _f, _g, _h for the rest. Those historical producer states are superseded by the closed source coordinator recorded above; do not restart generation from this historical note.
- Build agents choose the best variant (v1-v3) when they use an image; the owner does not cull.
